This repository contains three  C++ projects that demonstrate fundamental programming and object-oriented concepts:

1.  CGPA Calculator  
2.  Login and Registration System  
3.  Basic Banking System

---

## 1️. CGPA Calculator

### Description:
A simple console-based CGPA calculator. It allows a student to enter grades and credit hours for multiple courses and calculates the GPA and CGPA.

### Features:
- Take input for number of courses
- Grade and credit input for each course
- GPA and CGPA calculation
- Display of per-course and final result

### How to Run:
```bash
g++ cgpa_calculator.cpp -o cgpa
./cgpa
```

## 2️. Login and Registration System

###  Description:
A simple login and registration system using file handling (or in-memory version). Users can register with a username and password, and log in with stored credentials.

###  Features:
- Register new users
- Prevent duplicate usernames
- Login verification
- File-based or in-memory version available

###  How to Run:
```bash
g++ login_system.cpp -o login
./login
```

## 3️. Basic Banking System

### Description:
A basic banking system using Object-Oriented Programming concepts. It allows for account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and viewing transaction history.

###  Features:
- Create accounts and customers
- Deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds
- Transaction history
- Balance display
- Class-based structure: `Customer`, `Account`, `Transaction`
- No STL/vector used (array-based version)

###  How to Run:
```bash
g++ banking.cpp -o banking
./banking
```

## Files Structure:

| File              | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `cgpa_calculator.cpp` | CGPA calculator source code        |
| `login_system.cpp`    | Login system source code           |
| `banking.cpp`         | Banking system source code         |
| `README.md`           | This documentation file            |

---

##  Concepts Used:
- Input/output operations
- Arrays and strings
- File handling (optional)
- Classes, objects, and encapsulation
- Menu-driven programming
- Basic validation and logic flow

---

##  Future Improvements:
- GUI interface using Qt or SFML
- File/database storage for all projects
- Password masking in login system
- CGPA calculator with letter grade support
